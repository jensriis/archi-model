        <documentation>The Interoperability specification viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that shall be considered when providing interoperability specifications. It provides an overview of Architecture Building Blocks from the different views, and depicts them as a taxonomy of interoperability specifications. Each EIRA© view has Architecture Building Blocks that support interoperability.

Each view’s interoperability specifications serve to define the interoperability aspects of catalogues and registries, addressing both their contents and the respective catalogue or registry as a whole. Given the linked nature of the EIRA©’s views, the interoperability specifications from all views can be considered to affect each individual catalogue or registry. However, the focus in each case is kept within the specific view to best capture the level of detail that each view’s specifications deal with.&#xD;
Narrative: An [Interoperability Specification] is a [Specification] and can be composed of other [Interoperability Specifications]. It exists at the four levels of interoperability defined in the European Interoperability Framework. &#xD;
This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlighting the interoperability specification related Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA©:&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:&#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view shows that a [Legal Interoperability Specification] is associated to a [Public Policy Formulation and Implementation Instrument], of which a [Binding Instrument] is a specialisation, and defines the interoperability aspects for a [Legislation Catalogue]. &#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the Organisational view shows that an [Organisational Interoperability Specification] describes the interoperability aspects for an [Interoperability Agreement], a [Public Service Catalogue] and/or the [Exchange of Business Information]. &#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view shows that a [Semantic Interoperability Specification] defines the interoperability aspects for [Data Set Catalogues] as well as the interoperability aspects for [Representations]. &#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the Technical view shows that a [Technical Interoperability Specification] is a [Technical Specification], it defines the interoperability aspects of a [Machine to Machine Interface], a [Human Interface], a [Network] and/or a [Service Registry Component]. The [Service Registry Component] provides a mechanism to register technical services within a catalogue to be discovered by others.&#xD;
5.	The selected building block of the EIF Underlying Principle view show that [Interoperability Specifications] realise [Interoperability Principles], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks.&#xD;

          <content>The Integrated Public Service Governance viewpoint models the most salient key interoperability enablers(*). The viewpoint uses the ArchiMate© motivation extension to assess the “Sharing and reuse” readiness, the “Exchange readiness” and the “Interoperability readiness” of solutions that are necessary to enable the efficient and effective delivery of public services across administrations. European public service provision often requires different public administrations to work together to meet end users’ needs and provide public services in an integrated way. When multiple organisations are involved there is a need for coordination and governance by the authorities with a mandate for planning, implementing and operating European public services. Services should be governed to ensure: integration, seamless execution, reuse of services and data, and development of new services and ‘building blocks'.&#xD;

Integrated Public Service Governance viewpoint should cover all layers: legal, organisational, semantic and technical. Ensuring interoperability when preparing legal instruments, organisation business processes, information exchange, services and components that  support European public services is a continuous task, as interoperability is regularly disrupted by changes to the environment, i.e. in legislation, the needs of businesses or citizens, the organisational structure of public administrations, the business processes, and by the emergence of new technologies.&#xD;

Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA© that are related to Interoperability Integrated Public Service Governance:&#xD;
1.	EIF [Interoperability Principles] are used to realise the overall goal of [Achieving Interoperability]. &#xD;
2.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Legal Interoperability] is realised by [Legislation Catalogues] that are used for provisioning/consuming legal texts and by [Public Policy Formulation and Implementation Instruments] that are used to ensure compatible legal/juridical certainty. &#xD;
3.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Organisational Interoperability] is realised by [Public Service catalogues] that are used for provisioning/consuming front-office public services as well as by the [Exchange of Business Information] that are used to ensure compatible interaction and by [Interoperability Agreements] that define the operational terms/conditions for “sharing and reuse” and exchange of information. &#xD;
4.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Semantic Interoperability] is realised by [Data Set Catalogues] that are used for provisioning/consuming data and by [Representations] that are used to ensure a compatible interpretation.&#xD;
5.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Technical Interoperability] is realised by [Service Registries] that are used for provisioning/consuming back-office services and by [Machine to Machine Interfaces] or [Human Interfaces] that are used to ensure compatible interfaces. &#xD;

Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlighting the focal building blocks of the EIRA©: &#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the legal view shows the [Public Policy] which is the mainspring of the solution. &#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organisational view shows a [Public Policy] that is implemented by a [Public Service] which can be an aggregation of other [Public Services] serving [Public Service Consumers] and is provided by a [Public Service Provider]. The [Public Service] is realized by a [Business Capability] which can be an aggregation of other [Business Capabilities]. A [Business capability] describes key functions supporting the [Public Service]. An [Exchange of Business Information] accesses [Business Information]. &#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view shows that the [Exchange of Business Information] is realized by a [Representation] of [Data] which describes interactions between public administrations, businesses, and citizens. &#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical views shows that an [Interoperable European Solution] supports one or more [Public Services] and lets consumers access it via [Machine to Machine Interface] and/or [Human Interface]. An [Interoperable European Solution] exposes one or more [Application Services] via its [Machine to Machine Interfaces] and/or Human Interfaces]. It makes use of [Orchestration Services] and [Choreography Services]. The [Interoperable European Solution] uses [Digital Service Infrastructure] which uses a [Hosting and Networking Infrastructure]. It can also use other [Interoperable European Solutions]. &#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the EIF Underlying Principle view show that [Interoperability Specifications] realise [Interoperability Principles], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks.&#xD;

1.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view show that a [Public Policy] is associated with a [Public Policy Cycle] where it is created and governed. An [Operational enabler], influenced by a [Public Policy Implementation Mandate] and a [Public Policy Approach], is a specialisation of a [Public Policy and Implementation Instrument], which realises a [Public Policy]. &#xD;

The [Security and Privacy Policy] is a specialisation of an [Organisational Policy].&#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view that [Data Policies] are specialisations of [Organisational Policies].&#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view show that a [Configuration and solution Cartography Service Component] realises a [Configuration and Solution Cartography Service]. An [Operational procedure] defines a process for operating a solution and [Configuration Management] is used in order to manage the technology stack of an organization. &#xD;

          <content>The Interoperability Security and Privacy viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks related to both security and privacy in the domain of interoperability. Citizens and businesses must be confident that when they interact with public authorities they are doing so in a secure and trustworthy environment and in full compliance with relevant regulations, e.g. the Regulation and Directive on data protection, and the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services. Public administrations must guarantee the citizens’ privacy, and the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of information provided by citizens and businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy are primary concerns in the provision of public services. When public administrations and other entities exchange official information, the information should be transferred, depending on security requirements, via a secure, harmonised, managed and controlled network. Transfer mechanisms should facilitate information exchanges between administrations, businesses and citizens. Appropriate mechanisms should allow secure exchange of electronically verified messages, records, forms and other kinds of information between the different systems; should handle specific security requirements and electronic identification and trust services such as electronic signatures/seals creation and verification; and should monitor traffic to detect intrusions, changes of data and other type of attacks.&#xD;

The difference with the application part of the Technical view (see Section 4.5) is that the Architecture Building Blocks in the infrastructure view are considered to be relevant for solutions in any sector of government.

Narrative: An [Interoperable European Solution] and its application components make use of cross-sectorial [Digital Service Infrastructures]. It provides access to data through [Infrastructure Data Source Enablers] such as [Forms Management Service], [Record Management Services], [Document Management Services], or [Content Management Services]. The [Data] can be archived using [e-Archiving Services] and published to external data sources with a [Data Publication Service]. [Collaboration Enablers] can exchange messages between [Interoperable European Solutions] using [Messaging Services] and exchange multimedia using [Audio-visual Services]. The [Application Services] provided by an [Interoperable European Solution] can be discovered by users or systems through [Discovery Enablers]. The administration and operational management of an [Interoperable European Solution] is performed through [Administration Enablers].  Trust between systems is established with [Trust Service Provisioning Components] realised using Signature validation and verification such as  [e-Signing Creation Service], [e-Signature Verification and Validation Service], [e-Signature Preservation Service], and through e-Seal services such as [e-Seal Creation Service], [e-Seal Verification and Validation Service], [e-Seal Preservation Service], and e-timestamping services such as [e-Timestamp Creation Service], [e-timestamp Verification and Validation Service]. Identity management is realised with [Identity Management Service]/[Identity Management Component]. Evidence of transaction between parties is realised using the [Registered Electronic Delivery Service]. The [Interoperable European Solution] can register its architecture, and application documentation using a [Configuration and Cartography service]. The [Interoperable European Solutions] and the [Digital Service Infrastructures] are deployed and operated through [Hosting and Networking Services Infrastructures], provided by a [Public / Private Hosting Facility], and make use of a [Public / Private Network] to exchange data. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Architecture Building Blocks defined in both the [Digital Service Infrastructure] and the [Hosting and Network Service] can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Technical Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Organisational view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that shall be considered in order to support organisational interoperability among providers and users of a public service.

Narrative: [Organisations] in the role of [Public Service Providers] supply [Public Services] to [Citizens] and [Businesses] and/or [Public Administrations] which have the role of [Public Service Consumer]. The [Public Service] is delivered according to its [Service Delivery Model].  [Public Services] are documented in [Public Service Catalogues] that can be used among others for service portfolio management. [Public Service Providers] can delegate the delivery of [Public Services] to [Public Service Delivery Agents] who will act on behalf of [Public Service Providers]. [Public Service Providers] can sign an [Interoperability Agreement] to agree on how to deliver a [Public Service] to its users. The delivery of these public services is realised through [Business Capabilities] using an [Exchange of Business Information] that exchanges [Business Information]. [Business Information] is instance oriented and is subject to [Business Rules] originating from [Organisational Interoperability Enablers] like [Organisational Structures], [Organisational Procedures], [Organisational Policies] or the [Organisational Skills] of the [Organisations] involved. The [Interoperability Organisational Authority] is responsible for [Interoperability Governance] which influences the [Interoperability Strategy]. The [Interoperability Strategy] implements the [Interoperability Framework].   [Interoperability Skills] are a specific form of [Organisational Skills] that allows the organisation to excel in interoperability. A [Security Framework] is a specific form of a [Security Policy] which is an [Organisational Policy] focussed on security related aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Organisational content] and each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Organisational Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Semantic view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that should be considered in order to support semantic interoperability of information exchanges between administrations, businesses and citizens.&#xD;

Narrative: [Business Information] is realised by a [Representation] of [Data].  [Data] can be grouped in [Data Sets], which can be documented in [Data Set Catalogues]. [Master Data], [Transactional Data], [Reference Data], [Open Data], [Descriptive Metadata] and [Base are specialisations of [Data].  [Representation] and [Data] are influenced by [Data Policies], which are [Organisational Policies], which is in turn are influenced by [Public Policies]. &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Semantic content] and each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Semantic Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation. The following [Semantic Interoperability Specifications] are identified: [Core Data Model] and [Data Entities] which are a specialisation of [Data Models], [Character Encoding Scheme], [Syntax Encoding Scheme], [Data Level Mapping], [Schema Level Mapping] or [Identifier Scheme].&#xD;

        <content>The European Interoperability Framework underlying principles view models the motivation of the EIRA© in terms of goals to be achieved and the principles to be followed in order to achieve interoperability in public services. &#xD;
The interoperability principles are fundamental behavioural aspects to drive interoperable public services.  They describe the context in which European public services are designed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
The twelve underlying principles of the EIF are grouped into four categories:&#xD;
1.	Principle setting the context for EU actions on interoperability (Subsidiarity and proportionality);&#xD;
2.	Core interoperability principles (Openness, Transparency, Reusability, Technological neutrality and data portability);&#xD;
3.	Principles related to generic user needs and expectations (User-centricity, Inclusion and accessibility, Security and privacy, Multilingualism);&#xD;
4.	Foundation principles for cooperation among public administrations (Administrative simplification, Preservation of information, Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency).</content>

  <purpose>This  file provides the ArchiMate model of the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). The EIRA has been developed in the context of Action of the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme. The EIRA is a reference architecture focused on the interoperability of digital public services. It is composed of the most important architecture building blocks needed to promote cross-border and cross-sector interactions between public administrations. It is based on the Service Oriented Architecture style and uses ArchiMate as a modelling notation. The EIRA implements the New European Interoperability Framework (EIF) . 

The latest release of the EIRA is available on Joinup: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/eia/description 
The latest release of the new EIF is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en</purpose>
